I am a Researcher at at [Camera Intelligence Lab](https://camera.pku.edu.cn), Peking University. My current research area lies on Computational Photography and Photometric Stereo. Specifically, I explore the field of illumination planning in photometric stereo, focusing on optimizing lighting conditions to achieve comparable performance to that of large-scale images while using a minimal number of images. I am pursuing my PhD in Peking University's Computer Science Department with Prof. Boxin Shi. Prior to that, I received my Master degree of Computer Science and Engineering from Sejong University, South Korea.
